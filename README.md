# Transit Map

## Overview


## Assumptions
* The API breaks out the different Green Line (and Red Line) branches into separate routes. There might be times when displaying this as one "line" would be more intuitive, but I think it is actually more realistic to keep them separate. It simplifies the reality that while they share some stops, they diverge -- you can never get to Riverside directly on a Green Line E train.
